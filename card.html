			<p>Even though the water is icy, polar bears are skilled swimmers.
			Healthy adult polar bears can swim for several days without stopping. 
			They swim from the mainland to large, floating ice islands that have broken away. 
			Seals often rest on these islands, and the polar bears can swim up quietly and pounce fiercely up on the ice before the seal can react.</p>
